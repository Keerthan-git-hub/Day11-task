    <p>The Royal Enfield Bullet 350, is one of the most popular retro-roadster bikes in India. It is one of the most iconic motorcycles ever sold by Royal Enfield and holds the unofficial title of the world’s longest-running production bike, as it has been produced continuously since 1931. The Bullet 350 continues with the authentic retro design with chrome and gold highlights, a halogen headlight, an analogue speedometer, and a single-piece seat. It gets the same 350cc engine from the Royal Enfield Classic 350.</p>

    <p>The Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 is a parallel twin retro-styled motorcycle introduced by Royal Enfield in 2018. It is the first modern twin cylinder motorcycle developed by the company. The bike was revealed in 2017, design inspired by the 1960s Interceptor which had a 750cc engine. The Interceptor 650 was unveiled alongside the Continental GT 650, which shares the same engine. The Interceptor is a retro-cruiser with relaxed ergonomics, while the Continental GT is a café-racer. Both models are sold in India, Australasia, Europe and the United States and South America. The bike is expected to become the biggest selling large-capacity twin in the world,[1] and in 2020 the Interceptor 650 was the UK's best-selling big bike.</p>
